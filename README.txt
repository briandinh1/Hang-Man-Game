Text based Hang Man game. No drawing of the man - just the letters :) EXE file for demo

User can choose a word length between 1 and 20, then the game generates a "word" based on a custom frequency map. 
I ran the Declaration of Independence through another program to count frequency of each letter and used that as the basis for the word generation. 
The program will randomly choose letters based on the weighted frequency of each letter.
